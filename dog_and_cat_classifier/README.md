# Image Classification using Convolution Network with Tensorflow.

## Key Notes:
Creates an image classifier model using a keras.Sequential and data Augmentation techniques.

Leveraged Transfer learning, Fine-tuning the last layers of the pre-trained model to improve model accuracy. 

The model gives an accuracy of 0.95 on Kaggle Dog and Cat Dataset.
